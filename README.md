# python_challenge_1_2025
This was a weekly exam of the Data Analyst Bootcamp from Irvine University.
This is the Python calculations for PyPoll and PyBank. 
I've used the class activities, the Xpert AI, ChatGPT, stackoverflow, and w3 schools to complete the challenge.
I have not used the starter file but created all the code in the main.py files for PyPoll and PyBank.
